# Smart Tools
Smart Tools is a RFID based inventory management system designed for Computer Science & Engineering department's Senior Design Lab at the University of Texas at Arlington.

## Project Goal
The goal of the Smart Tools project was to develop an inventory management system that made the job of keeping the Senior Design Lab's toolboxes organized quick and easy. Our team sought to accomplish this goal using RFID technology. Using RFID tag on tools inside of each toolbox and an Impinj RFID reader/antennas our Smart Tools inventory management software would be able to help the custodian of the Senior Design Lab keep track of all the tools inside of the Senior Design Lab's toolboxes.
